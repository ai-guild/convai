# The Conversation Intelligence Challenge


[https://deeppavlov.github.io/convai/](https://deeppavlov.github.io/convai/)


Dialogue systems and conversational agents – including chatbots, personal assistants and voice control interfaces – are becoming increasingly widespread in our daily lives. NIPS is sponsoring an open competition to create a chatbot that can hold an intelligent conversation with a human partner.
